# tictactest
Expedia test
Hi there.
OS/Tools/Technologies used to develop the tictac.
-MacOS/Eclipse Mars
-Java 8
-Maven
-Spring
-JUnit (there is no test implemented beause I dont know how to test a main class)

I tried to keep simple as possible. To run the game, run the class App then type the line and column numbers for "x" or "o" player.

If you type a number out of the range (1-3) the game will be over. If you type one line and column selected before you need to type other line and column.

Thanks
